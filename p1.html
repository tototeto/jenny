				Jenny is a cute little asian girl who is really good at art. She is about 5'2" I think and wears heels even though
				her hight is like. Super awesome. She is also hella smart and somehow actually enjoys math, which is super hella lit.
				She's dating some random dude named like, Thong, or Talc, or something dumb like that, and he plays Fortnite. She smells
				like awesome, which she is. Objectively.
