			<p>
				I love everything about Jenny. This is including but not limited to: Her cute yet fearless laugh; Her gorgeous
				smooth hair; Her soft warm hands; Her hugs which I could participate in for hours; Her voice which I have 
				described as both high and low simultaneously; Her apparent lack of sense of smell, as she somehow believes
				I don't smell like dog piss; The way she tells me she loves me; Her occasional willingness to give me amazing
				beautiful tatoos. Basically, shes like, the perfect human. Like if all humans were equally perfect, she would
				still be even more perfect because fuck you.
