		<div class='poem'>
			<p>
				Shes angelic without reason
			</p>
			<p>
				Shes romantic as a dove
			</p>
			<p>
				For her my heart is open season
			</p>
			<p>
				She has all of my love
			</p>
			<p>
			.
			</p>
			<p>
				With everything seems less cringe
			</p>
			<p>
				I could spill my guts all day
			</p>
			<p>
				With all shows are fun to binge
			</p>
			<p>
				I promise I'm not gay
			</p>
			<p>
			.
			</p>
			<p>
				How I'm worthy, I do not know
			</p>
			<p>
				But i can say with certainty that she is my life
			</p>
			<p>
				Inside joke time, ready: Bobo ;^)
			</p>
			<p>
				I hope one day she will be my wife
			</p>
			<p>
			.
			</p>
			<p>
				My poetic skill is clearly rivaled
			</p>
			<p>
				But her beauty is not
			</p>
			<p>
				I may not pay attention in english class (I know it doesn't ryhme, I did my best)
			</p>
			<p>
				But we despise it together
			</p>
			<p>
			.
			</p>
			<p>
				I apologize for making you read this
			</p>
			<p>
				But I really hope you know
			</p>
			<p>
				That in my heart you are my blood
			</p>
			<p>
				I will love you through life and death
			</p>
			<p>
			.
			</p>
